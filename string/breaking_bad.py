"""
Given an api which returns an array of chemical names and an array of chemical
symbols, display the chemical names with their symbol surrounded by square
brackets:

Ex:
Chemicals array: ['Amazon', 'Microsoft', 'Google']
Symbols: ['I', 'Am', 'cro', 'Na', 'le', 'abc']

Output:
[Am]azon, Mi[cro]soft, Goog[le]

If the chemical string matches more than one symbol, then choose the one with
longest length. (ex. 'Microsoft' matches 'i' and 'cro')

My solution:
(I sorted the symbols array in descending order of length and ran loop over
chemicals array to find a symbol match(using indexOf in javascript) which
worked. But I din't make it through the interview, I am guessing my solution
was O(n2) and they expected an efficient algorithm.

One approach is to use a Trie for the dictionary (the symbols), and then match
brute force. The complexity will depend on the dictionary;
if all are suffixes of the other, it will be n*m
(where m is the size of the dictionary). For example, in Python:
"""
