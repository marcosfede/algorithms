--- Part Two ---
You're not sure what it's trying to paint, but it's definitely not a registration identifier. The Space Police are getting impatient.

Checking your external ship cameras again, you notice a white panel marked "emergency hull painting robot starting panel". The rest of the panels are still black, but it looks like the robot was expecting to start on a white panel, not a black one.

Based on the Space Law Space Brochure that the Space Police attached to one of your windows, a valid registration identifier is always eight capital letters. After starting the robot on a single white panel instead, what registration identifier does it paint on your hull?
