--- Day 13: Care Package ---
As you ponder the solitude of space and the ever-increasing three-hour roundtrip for messages between you and Earth, you notice that the Space Mail Indicator Light is blinking. To help keep you sane, the Elves have sent you a care package.

It's a new game for the ship's arcade cabinet! Unfortunately, the arcade is all the way on the other end of the ship. Surely, it won't be hard to build your own - the care package even comes with schematics.

The arcade cabinet runs Intcode software like the game the Elves sent (your puzzle input). It has a primitive screen capable of drawing square tiles on a grid. The software draws tiles to the screen with output instructions: every three output instructions specify the x position (distance from the left), y position (distance from the top), and tile id. The tile id is interpreted as follows:

0 is an empty tile. No game object appears in this tile.
1 is a wall tile. Walls are indestructible barriers.
2 is a block tile. Blocks can be broken by the ball.
3 is a horizontal paddle tile. The paddle is indestructible.
4 is a ball tile. The ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects.
For example, a sequence of output values like 1,2,3,6,5,4 would draw a horizontal paddle tile (1 tile from the left and 2 tiles from the top) and a ball tile (6 tiles from the left and 5 tiles from the top).

Start the game. How many block tiles are on the screen when the game exits?
